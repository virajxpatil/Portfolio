Curious | Energetic | Optimistic  

An aspiring engineering manager, who believes in the power of asking the right questions.  I always want to know the business impact of the technical strategies on the end-users of the product. During my 3+ years' experience, I have worked in technical, analytical, and customer support roles which have given me strong technical background and customer empathy needed for product management roles. I have experience in conducting customer interviews to prioritize their pain-points and working with the engineering, R&amp;D, and sales teams to scale the existing product in B2B SaaS space. Moreover, having led projects from scratch, I have experience in product strategy, life-cycle management, data resource planning, and I am fluent with cross-functional teams.  I‚Äôm looking for a Product Manger role where I can build products that can make technology accessible to everyone.
